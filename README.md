My Tasks

A simple Android to‑do app built with Kotlin, MVVM, Room and Material Components.
Keep track of tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates and priority badges (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW). Add, edit, delete and toggle completion status — all backed by a local SQLite database.

Features
Add / Edit / Delete Tasks
Open a dialog to enter title, description and due date.
Priority Badges
Color‑coded HIGH (red), MEDIUM (orange) and LOW (blue) labels on each card.
Completion Toggle
Check a task’s box to mark it done — updated in the database.
Empty State
When no tasks exist, shows “No tasks yet. Tap + to add a new task.”
Material UI
White app bar with black “My Tasks” title, light grey background, white rounded cards, and a teal FAB.
Room + LiveData + ViewModel
MVVM architecture ensures separation of concerns and reactive UI updates.
